# 3D Tic-Tac-Toe AI üïπÔ∏è

Experience the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a new dimension. This project features a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can challenge advanced AI opponents that utilize various strategies, including Reinforcement Learning and Minimax algorithms.

## Project Overview üìú

This 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game brings an extra layer of complexity and strategy to the traditional game by extending it into three dimensions and integrating sophisticated AI algorithms. Players can test their skills against AI that not only reacts to the current board state but also learns from past games and predicts future outcomes.

## Features üåü

- **AI Opponent**: Compete against AI trained with Reinforcement Learning or calculated through the Minimax algorithm.
- **Basic Interface**: Manage your game through a straightforward and intuitive interface.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `bash'
   git clone https://github.com/KrishM123/3DTicTacToeAI
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution:
   `Build -> Build Solution'
4. Execute the built executable:
  Navigate to the output directory and run 3DTicTacToeAI.exe

## AI Implementations üß†

### Reinforcement Learning

- **State-Action Pairs**: Every possible state and action taken by the AI is recorded along with the game's final result.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: The AI updates its strategy by learning from the outcomes of its actions to enhance its gameplay over time.

### Minimax Algorithm

- **Depth-Limited Search**: Simulates all possible moves and their outcomes to a certain depth.
- **Optimal Strategy**: Evaluates potential future game states to determine the best move by minimizing potential losses.

## Contributing ü§ù
